    <h1>About the TOPS Yearbook Club!</h1>
    <p>This is the about page for the TOPS Yearbook Club. Here, we create and design the annual yearbook for our school, capturing memories and events throughout the academic year. Our club is dedicated to showcasing the creativity and spirit of our student body through writing, photos, and graphic design.</p>
    <p>Members of the Yearbook Club work collaboratively to plan, organize, and produce the yearbook. We hold meetings every two weeks to discuss themes, layouts, and content ideas, ensuring that every aspect of the yearbook reflects the diverse experiences of the students, from freshmen to seniors.</p>
    <p>Joining the Yearbook Club is a fantastic opportunity to develop creative skills and unleash your inner artist, while also making lasting friendships and contributing to a cherished school tradition (not to mention the curriculum boost!). Whether you're interested in taking photos, writing captions, or designing pages, there's a place for you in the Yearbook Club!</p>
    <p>We welcome all students who are passionate about documenting school life and eager to be part of a creative team. Come join us and help create something special that will be treasured and remembered for years to come!</p>
